# Advent of Code 2022

This my repo for the Advent of Code 2022

You can find more information of that challenge here: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Challenge

My personal challenge for this advent of code is to write it with the latest .Net Framework at the time (.Net 7).

I will also code using a test driven development (TDD) approach and try to get 100% code coverage.
